# TrueTimer

This is a React Native App made for enforcing a fantasy football punishment, where the loser of thee league has to complete punishments to have time removed from watching Amy Schumer's comedy special. Hindsight beigh forced watching a comedy special, even if it's unfunny, isn't really that big of a punishmnet. But c'est la vie.
This is meant for personal use, but feel free to use/examine/improve my code

Be warned, the code is poor and the comments are worse ;)
