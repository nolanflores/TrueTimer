# TrueTimer

This is a React Native App made for enforcing a fantasy football punishment, where the loser of the league has to complete tasks to have time removed from watching Amy Schumer's comedy specials. Hindsight: beig forced watching a comedy special, even if it's unfunny, isn't really that big of a punishmnet. C'est la vie.
This was meant for personal use, but feel free to use/examine/improve the code

Be warned, the code is poor and the comments are worse ;)
